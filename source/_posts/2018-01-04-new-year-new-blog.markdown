First post! It's the start of a new year and I figured that I would create a new blog of all of my ramblings and projects.  This is my first go with a static site generator, I'm overall impressed with using [Jekyll][jekyll], especailly in combination [GitHub pages][github-pages].  Keeping it short and sweet for now, I should have something more substantial than a first post soon.
